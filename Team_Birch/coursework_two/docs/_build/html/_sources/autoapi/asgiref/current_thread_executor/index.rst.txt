.. py:class:: CurrentThreadExecutor

   Bases: :py:obj:`concurrent.futures.Executor`


   An Executor that actually runs code in the thread it is instantiated in.
   Passed to other threads running async code, so they can run sync code in
   the thread they came from.


   .. py:method:: run_until_future(future: Future[Any]) -> None

      Runs the code in the work queue until a result is available from the future.
      Should be run from the thread the executor is initialised in.



   .. py:method:: submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)

      Submits a callable to be executed with the given arguments.

      Schedules the callable to be executed as fn(*args, **kwargs) and returns
      a Future instance representing the execution of the callable.

      :returns: A Future representing the given call.
