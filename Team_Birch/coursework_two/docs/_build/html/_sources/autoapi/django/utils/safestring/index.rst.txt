django.utils.safestring
=======================

.. py:module:: django.utils.safestring

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Functions for working with "safe strings": strings that can be displayed safely
   without further escaping in HTML. Marking something as a "safe string" means
   that the producer of the string has already turned characters that should not
   be interpreted by the HTML engine (e.g. '<') into the appropriate entities.
