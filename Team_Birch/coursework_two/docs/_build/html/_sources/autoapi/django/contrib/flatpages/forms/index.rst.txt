Module Contents
---------------

.. py:class:: FlatpageForm(*args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`django.forms.ModelForm`


   The main implementation of all the Form logic. Note that this class is
   different than Form. See the comments by the Form class for more info. Any
   improvements to the form API should be made to this class, not to the Form
   class.


   .. py:attribute:: url


   .. py:class:: Meta

      .. py:attribute:: model


      .. py:attribute:: fields
         :value: '__all__'




   .. py:method:: clean_url()


   .. py:method:: clean()

      Hook for doing any extra form-wide cleaning after Field.clean() has been
      called on every field. Any ValidationError raised by this method will
      not be associated with a particular field; it will have a special-case
      association with the field named '__all__'.
