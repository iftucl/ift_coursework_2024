.. py:class:: GeometryField(*, srid=None, geom_type=None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`django.forms.Field`


   This is the basic form field for a Geometry.  Any textual input that is
   accepted by GEOSGeometry is accepted by this form.  By default,
   this includes WKT, HEXEWKB, WKB (in a buffer), and GeoJSON.


   .. py:attribute:: widget


   .. py:attribute:: geom_type
      :value: 'GEOMETRY'



   .. py:attribute:: default_error_messages


   .. py:attribute:: srid
      :value: None



   .. py:method:: to_python(value)

      Transform the value to a Geometry object.



   .. py:method:: clean(value)

      Validate that the input value can be converted to a Geometry object
      and return it. Raise a ValidationError if the value cannot be
      instantiated as a Geometry.



   .. py:method:: has_changed(initial, data)

      Compare geographic value of data with its initial value.



.. py:class:: GeometryCollectionField(*, srid=None, geom_type=None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`GeometryField`


   This is the basic form field for a Geometry.  Any textual input that is
   accepted by GEOSGeometry is accepted by this form.  By default,
