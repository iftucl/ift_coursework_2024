Module: test_tailwind_config

This module contains tests for validating the contents and structure of the `tailwind.config.js` 
file in a frontend project. Specifically, it checks if certain expected keys, values, and settings 
are present in the configuration file.

Test cases:
- Ensures the presence of specific keys and values in the Tailwind CSS configuration.
