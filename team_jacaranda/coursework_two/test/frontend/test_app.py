"""
Module: test_app_structure

This module contains tests to verify the structure and functionality of the frontend 
`App.js` file located within the `modules/frontend/src/` directory. These tests ensure
that the file includes essential elements like React hooks, JSX components, and event handling.

Test cases:
- Structural validation of the App.js file (checking for required elements like hooks, JSX structure, and HTML elements).
- Functional validation to ensure that the App.js contains necessary event handling logic (e.g., `onClick` event binding and state update logic).

    Test the structure of the App.js file.

    This test verifies that the `App.js` file contains the essential React elements, including 
    the use of the `useState` hook, JSX structure, and required HTML elements such as `<input>` and `<button>`. 
    It ensures the basic structure of the component is set up correctly.

    It performs the following checks:
    - Verifies that `useState` is used in the file.
    - Verifies that the file contains a return statement with JSX.
    - Verifies the inclusion of an `<input>` element.
    - Verifies the inclusion of a `<button>` element.

    :raises AssertionError: If any of the above checks fail.

    Test the functionality of the App.js file to check if it includes add functionality.

    This test checks if the `App.js` file contains logic for handling button click events and 
    updating state. Specifically, it verifies that an `onClick` event handler is present and that 
    there is a state update logic, indicated by calls to functions that start with `set`.

    It performs the following checks:
    - Verifies that the file contains an `onClick` event handler.
    - Verifies that a state update function (e.g., `setState`) is called within the file.
