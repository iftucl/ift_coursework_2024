"""
Module: test_index_imports_and_mounts

This module contains a test function that verifies the correct imports and mounting logic 
within the `index.js` file in a frontend project. Specifically, it ensures that:
- The `App` component is imported correctly.
- The `ReactDOM.createRoot` method is called for mounting.
- The `root.render` method is invoked to render the `App` component.

Since Python cannot directly mock or execute JavaScript files, this test performs static checks on 
the content of the `index.js` file to confirm the required JavaScript functionality.

Test case:
- Ensures proper import and mounting of the `App` component in `index.js`.

    - Importing the `App` component with `import App from`.
    - Calling `ReactDOM.createRoot` to initialize the app mounting point.
    - Using `root.render` to render the `App` component.
