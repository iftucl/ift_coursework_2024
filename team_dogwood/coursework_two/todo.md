- update main script to run app (siyu scripts)
- update scripts to use central config (siyu script)
- sardor - test UI and visualisation

Documentation
- openmetadata experimented with but too much effort to create server, currently going with postgres for metadata, this would be automated in large scale product that constantly updates new metrics and moved to something scalable like openmetadata.
- scheduled using aps scheduler. can be run via cli. add instructions for using config instead (via env)
- write readme with instructions for how to use
