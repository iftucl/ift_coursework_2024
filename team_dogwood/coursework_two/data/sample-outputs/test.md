* Carbon dioxide equivalent.

† Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per dollar of gross merchandise sales.

‡ To understand what this goal should encompass, we model and measure the energy consumed by our devices in different types of use, then project their total average global annual electricity consumption.

† † Progress from July 2021 through December 2022.

‡ ‡ Goal achieved in January 2024. Progress from July 2021 through January 2024.

§ Food waste intensity is a measure of food waste as a percentage of total food handled by weight.

# Water positive means AWS will return more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations. A number below 100% indicates AWS is still working to meet the water positive goal.
