Architecture Overview
===================

This section provides an overview of the system architecture and data flow.

System Architecture
-----------------

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

.. uml::

   @startuml
   package "Team Ginkgo Coursework Two" {
      [Main Application] as main
      [Data Processing] as process
      [Database] as db
      [API Services] as api
   }

   main --> process : Process Data
   process --> db : Store/Retrieve
   process --> api : Fetch Data
   @enduml

Data Flow
---------

The data flow in the system follows these steps:

.. uml::

   @startuml
   actor User
   participant "Main Application" as app
   participant "Data Processor" as processor
   participant "Database" as db
   participant "External API" as api

   User -> app: Request
   app -> processor: Process Data
   processor -> db: Store/Retrieve
   processor -> api: Fetch Data
   api --> processor: Response
   processor --> app: Processed Data
   app --> User: Result
   @enduml

Components
----------

1. Main Application
   - Entry point of the system
   - Handles user requests
   - Coordinates between components
   - Provides command-line interface

2. Data Processing
   - Handles data transformation
   - Implements business logic
   - Manages data validation
   - Processes CSR reports

3. Database
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Stores application data
   - Handles data persistence
   - Manages database migrations

4. API Services
   - External service integration
   - Data fetching and processing
   - Error handling and retries
   - API key management

Security
--------

The system implements the following security measures:

- Environment-based configuration
- Secure database connections
- API key management
- Input validation
- Error handling and logging
- Data encryption
- Access control
