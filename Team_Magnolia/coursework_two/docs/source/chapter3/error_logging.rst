Error Logging, Lineage Management and Future Improvements
-------------------------------------------------------------
Beyond validation and fallback recovery, robust error tracking and data lineage management are essential for operational reliability, auditability, and continuous improvement.

Error Logging Mechanism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The system logs errors arising throughout the extraction and validation pipeline in a structured and centralized manner. Error types include document parsing failures, malformed LLM outputs, validation rule violations, and database write conflicts.
All errors are formatted as structured JSON records comprising the error type, document reference, timestamp, error message, and severity classification. These are stored centrally in a MongoDB collection (csr_errors) and are used to generate post-batch summaries for triage and debugging.

Proposed Enhancements for Validation and Metadata Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While the current validation and logging architecture is robust for pilot-scale operations, several enhancements are envisioned to further increase the system’s resilience, transparency, and scalability.
Integration with OpenMetadata
OpenMetadata is an open-source metadata management and data governance tool that offers centralized 	dashboards, data lineage visualization, and policy enforcement capabilities.
By integrating OpenMetadata, the project could achieve:
Automatic visualization of end-to-end data flows
Centralized cataloging of indicators, tables, and transformations
Impact analysis for downstream changes (e.g., changing an indicator definition)
This would significantly enhance auditability and make compliance reporting easier.
Advanced Anomaly Detection for Validation
While the current validation framework catches structural errors, it does not yet detect semantic 	anomalies - for instance, a negative water consumption figure or an implausibly large Scope 1 emission 	value.
Future versions could incorporate:
Statistical range checks based on historical distributions
Z-score or IQR-based outlier detection on numeric fields
Machine-learning classifiers trained to detect illogical indicator values
Anomalies would be flagged for manual review before final acceptance.
Real-Time Error Monitoring
At present, errors are logged post hoc and require manual querying. Introducing real-time error 	monitoring using tools such as Sentry or Prometheus + Grafana would allow:
Immediate notification of extraction failures via email or dashboards
Time-series tracking of error rates and model performance
Threshold-based alerts for operational issues (e.g., sudden spike in validation failures)
Version Control for Extraction Models and Validation Schemas
Currently, model versions and schema versions are recorded as metadata fields. Moving forward, tighter 	integration with version control systems (e.g., Git-based tagging of prompt templates, validation rules, 	and model checkpoints) could allow full reproducibility of historical extractions even after system 	updates.
This would enable a “time-travel” capability — reconstructing exactly what the dataset looked like at 	any past processing point.
Fallback Self-Learning
Over time, fallback heuristics could become self-improving by mining manually corrected records. For 	example, every time a human reviewer corrects a wrongly inferred year or indicator mapping, the 	system could:
Log the correction
Update internal synonym dictionaries or regex patterns
Improve future extraction accuracy automatically
Such semi-supervised learning would reduce human workload progressively as the dataset scales.
