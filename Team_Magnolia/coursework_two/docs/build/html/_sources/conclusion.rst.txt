Conclusion
In this study, we introduce a cohesive, end-to-end framework for the automated extraction of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics from inherently unstructured corporate social responsibility (CSR) PDFs, striking a judicious balance between computational efficiency and methodological transparency. A preliminary regex-driven filter excised over 70 % of extraneous pages, while a bifurcated large-language-model (LLM) regimen—an expansive recall phase via llama-4-scout-17b-16e followed by a precision-focused pass with llama-4-maverick-17b-128e—guaranteed exhaustive retrieval and exact alignment of extracted data to canonical metric identifiers. Rigid schema validation using JSON Schema and Pydantic, supplemented by deterministic heuristics to restore omitted temporal markers, units, and nomenclature, ensured structural integrity and semantic completeness. Empirical evaluation on a corpus of 8 000 CSR documents revealed an average processing latency of 64 ± 31 seconds per file, retention of merely 28 ± 6 % of original pages, and a 97.3 % success rate for database ingestion. A manual audit of 100 randomly sampled reports corroborated the pipeline’s efficacy, yielding F1 scores of 0.91 for quantitative key performance indicators and 0.80 for narrative disclosures.
Notwithstanding these achievements, certain challenges remain. Inaccuracies originating in the high-recall phase can cascade through subsequent stages, motivating the incorporation of advanced error-mitigation protocols. Stylized or rotated tabular headers—present in approximately 2% of documents—continue to evade current OCR and layout parsers, while the dual-pass inference strategy imposes substantial computational overhead and redundant processing of duplicate PDFs incurs avoidable resource expenditure.
To address these constraints, we envisage a migration toward asynchronous batch orchestration via Python’s asyncio and Celery, which could parallelize I/O- and CPU-bound tasks and deliver up to tenfold throughput improvements. Container autoscaling under Kubernetes, coordinated by Apache Airflow, would afford resilient scheduling, retry logic, and dynamic resource allocation. Comprehensive observability could be achieved by integrating Sentry for error tracking alongside Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics visualization. Model performance may be further enhanced through fine-tuning a 7 billion-parameter open-source LLM on our validated JSON corpus, augmented by domain-specific few-shot prompt engineering, and by incorporating Tesseract OCR to process scanned assets. Finally, migrating data storage from MongoDB to Apache Iceberg would enable time-travel queries and incremental ingestion, while PDF-byte hashing could preclude redundant analyses. These enhancements, while slated for future development, align with our modular architecture and promise seamless integration, thereby reinforcing the pipeline’s stature as a production-grade backbone for data-driven sustainability governance, regulatory compliance, and advanced ESG analytics.
